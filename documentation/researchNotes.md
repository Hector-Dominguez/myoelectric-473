##Myoelectric Sensor Info
* Adafruit Myoware Sensor:
	* Outputs the envelope of the EMG signal 
		* (0v - Vsupply)
	* Placement Requirements:
		*   "The electrodes should be place in the middle of the muscle body and should be
aligned with the orientation of the muscle fibers. Placing the sensor in other locations will
reduce the strength and quality of the sensorâ€™s signal due to a reduction of the number of
motor units measured and interference attributed to crosstalk."
